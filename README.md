Description:
This project involves sentiment analysis of tweets to classify them as positive, neutral, or negative. The dataset consists of tweets with labeled sentiments, and the goal is to train machine learning models to predict the sentiment based on the tweet's text. The project implements data preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF. Various classification models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.

The evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The model's performance was measured on a test set to assess its ability to predict sentiments effectively.

Achieved Results:
Preprocessed the tweet data to convert raw text into a format suitable for machine learning.
Implemented and compared multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Achieved an accuracy of 77% using Logistic Regression and 72% using Gradient Boosting on the test data.
Precision, recall, and F1-scores were evaluated across sentiment categories, with the negative sentiment achieving the highest accuracy.
